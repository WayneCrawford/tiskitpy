# TiSKitPy

Routines for time series data processing

Uses the obspy seismological Trace, Stream (data) and Inventory (metadata)
classes, but should work for non-seismology datasets as well


[Documentation](https://tiskitpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)


## Classes

- `CleanRotator`: rotate data to minimize noise on vertical channel
- `DataCleaner`: Transfer_Function-based data cleaning
- `Decimator`: Decimate time series and update metadata with the decimator's
  response
- `SpectralDensity`: Calculate and manipulate spectral density functions.
- `TimeSpans`: Specify time spans to be removed, kept, zeroed, etc.
- `ResponseFunctions`: Frequency response functions for a given input channel.
            
               
## Functions

- `FIR_corr`: transform zero-phase data to minimum phase (only works for
              LCHEAPO loggers, need to update to calculate/work for any
              zero-phase filter)
- `readMSEED`: read in MSEED data, including if the file is too big (> 2 GB)
               for obspy's read() function
- `rptransient`: calculate and remove periodic transient (VERY manual!).  
 	Based on Matlab code by E Wielandt, used in Deen et al., 2017

- `PetersonNoiseModel`: return the Peterson High and Low Noise Models
