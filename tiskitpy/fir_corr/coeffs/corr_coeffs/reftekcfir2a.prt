# How to remove the noncausal FIR filter response from a digital record x[n]:
# 1. Reverse sequence x[n] in time to obtain sequence x'[n]
# 2. Filter reversed input sequence x'[] using the     
#    difference equation:                              
#                                                       
#            mx                mx                       
#            --                --                       
#    y'[i] =  > a[k]*y'[i-k]   + > b[l] x'[i-l]         
#            __                __                       
#            k=1               l=0                      
#                                                       
#    This corresponds to equ. (8.15) in 'Scherbaum, F: Of poles and zeros,
#    Fundamentals of Digital Seismology, Kluwer Academic Publ., 1996' 
#    mx = number of AR coefficients 
#    b[l] = MA coefficients for l = 0, mx
#    a[k] = AR coefficients for k = 1, mx
#    y'[] = output sequence                                   
# 3. Reverse the output sequence y'[] in time again to obtain the corrected 
#    sequence y[n]! 
# 4. Apply the time tag correction! Since the correction procedure works on
#    the time inverted trace (cf. step 1), a signal front (onset) will appear
#    TIMETAG samples (= TIMETAG/FDIG_EFF secs) too early in the corrected 
#    sequence. In contrast, the envelope of a bandlimited signal, will not be 
#    advanced quite as much. The amount is given by the negative group delay
#    of the correction filter. For a discussion of onset properties and how 
#    they are affected by filters, see Scherbaum, F: Of poles and zeros.
