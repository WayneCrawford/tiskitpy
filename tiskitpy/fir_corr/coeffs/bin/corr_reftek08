# REFTEK 72-08 FIR filter correction 
# USAGE: corr_reftek08 <input file> <fdig>
# input file: single colummn ASCII format (1 value per line)
# fdig: digitization frequency of the input file in Hz 
#
#
# There are 2 different REF TEK instruments which use the 24 bit part
# from Crystal.  The 72A-08 is the 6 channel unit.  In this unit the
# part is always run at 1000 sps and the output fed into the DSP
# for filtering to the final sample rate.  In this part the initial
# sample rate is 128,000 sps and this is then filtered and decimated
# to the final sample rate as shown below:
# 
# 72A-08 1000 sps 
#        Stage   Dec     Input SR        Filter

# TEST VERSION!!: Correction back up to the 2000 Hz datastream
# currently supported values for fdig are only: 100
